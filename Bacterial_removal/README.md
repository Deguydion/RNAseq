## Purpose

Remove contaminant sequences from bacterial origines.
\
We use bbsplit from https://github.com/BioInfoTools/BBMap/blob/master/sh/bbsplit.sh
\
We use a aggregation of common bacterial genomes that are available on NCBI.
The file is called bacterialgenome.fa

## Usage 

Install BBmap and bbsplit.
\
Run bbsplit.sh
\
The script is a loop that takes all the samples from the folder. 
Script can also be done for samples one by one.
